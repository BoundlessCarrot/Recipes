# Jordan's Recipe Collection

My plan is to put markdown and Cooklang versions of every recipe I get, either from my family or just good sources across the internet.

I'll also try to sync this repo with a backup locally and on my webserver.

And I'll try and organize it somehow. Maybe some kind of tagging system because I can't decide between family/internet or by dish types or whatever. With tagging I can kind of do all of them.

Maybe in the future some kind of web app is in order to search thru tags and find a recipe (the cooklang cli seems like a good option for this).
