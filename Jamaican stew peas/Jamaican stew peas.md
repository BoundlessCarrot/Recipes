## Ingredients

### For the Stew
- 2 cups red kidney beans (354g)
- 6 cups water (1.4 litres)
- 1 can full fat coconut milk (or 2 cups/14oz/400ml)
- 1 medium carrot, chopped
- Bell peppers (half green and half yellow, chopped) (optional)
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- ½ teaspoon ground pimento (allspice) (2.5g)
- 1 tablespoon all purpose seasoning (15g)
- 2 teaspoon black pepper (10g)
- 6 sprigs of thyme, tied in a bundle
- Pink salt to taste
- Scotch bonnet (optional)

### For the Spinners
- 1 ¼ cups gluten free flour (170g)
- ½ teaspoon pink salt (2.5g)
- Warm water (set aside about ¾ cup, you may not use all of it)

## Instructions

1. Place the dried peas in a bowl with enough water to cover the peas and leave to soak overnight or several hours.
2. The next day, discard the water and rinse the peas.
3. Add the peas to a large saucepan with the 6 cups of water along with the garlic and onions and tied thyme sprigs.
4. Bring to a boil then reduce to medium heat, place the lid half on and simmer for roughly an hour or until peas are soft (you should be able to mash them with ease when they are done)
5. Add the carrots, bell peppers, pimento, black pepper, all purpose seasoning and pink salt.
6. Add the spinners then pour in the coconut milk.
7. Bring the pot to the boil then reduce to medium-low.
8. Allow the spinners to start cooking for 10 minutes then either remove about ½ cups worth of peas and mash them then return/stir them into the pot. (you can do this by using the back of a spoon instead)
9. Add the scotch bonnet then place the lid half on and allow the stew to simmer until it thickens (it should take about 30-45 minutes)
10. Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning if needed.
11. Remove the thyme stems and scotch bonnet before serving.

### To make the spinners
1. Place the flour in a large bowl with the pink salt
2. Pour the water (at little at a time) into the bowl and at the same time use your other hand to form a pliable dough ball.
3. Then pinch off a small amount of the dough and roll it into the palm of your hand to make your spinners.

## Notes
- Traditionally stew peas are made using dried red kidney beans. I haven't tried fast tracking the recipe with canned peas.
- Feel free to serve this with Brown Rice or Cauliflower Rice for a low carb option.
- Make sure the scotch bonnet isn't pricked or burst or that will cause the recipe to be really spicy.
- Mashing the peas makes the stew much thicker, some people like to allow the beans to naturally thicken on their own but I like to help the process by doing this and recommend it.
- You can make the spinners while the peas are cooking, that way you will save some time.
- If you are concerned about calories omit the spinners although spinners are traditionally paired with stew peas and rice.
